# Project Setup Instructions
## Working with the layout

 - Don't touch the psm1 file
 - Place functions you export in `functions/` (can have subfolders)
 - Place private/internal functions invisible to the user in `internal/functions` (can have subfolders)
 - Don't add code directly to the `postimport.ps1` or `preimport.ps1`.
   Those files are designed to import other files only.
 - When adding files you load during `preimport.ps1`, be sure to add corresponding entries to `filesBefore.txt`.
   The text files are used as reference when compiling the module during the build script.
 - When adding files you load during `postimport.ps1`, be sure to add corresponding entries to `filesAfter.txt`.
   The text files are used as reference when compiling the module during the build script.
